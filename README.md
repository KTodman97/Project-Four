# Proposal Questions:
Project Description: In this project, we are working on exploring the Opioid Crisis in the United States over time (from 2006-2019). Our research examines this correlation by examining relationships between race/ethnicity, age, prescription drug & its risk to addiction. We hope to create a model to help predict opiate use in the future based on some of these relationships.

1. What age groups succumbs most and least by Opioid overdoses?

2. What race/ethnicity succumbs most and least to Opioid Ovedoses?

3. Which top three states have the most Opioid related deaths?

4. Where do people get their Opioids? Are the means in which they are prescribed legal/illegal?
